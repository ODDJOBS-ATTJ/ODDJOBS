# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Dependencies

- Install `react-router-dom`
- When importing CSS, just use `import` + `link to your file in css`
- Most likely they will have the same name when in JS so just make sure

# Other Notes

- Will continue on the other pages by tomorrow
