FRONT END IS FULLY FINISHED, BUT BACKEND IS LACKING

DISCLAIMER: in workers page, search is non functional so use url (services/search)

Home page does not work since it has css conflicts so we removed it. 
Make sure to import the SQL to phpMyAdmin and npm install for all the dependencies

Our working features are these:
- Login page with verification
- Registration with email verification + popup
- Email verification has a hashed ID which is unique and uploaded to database; when a registration is submitted, it sends an email. When the verification landing page (url from the email) is entered, it makes the verification NULL, and isVerified is ticked to 1.
- Each page has its authentication using cookies, and logging out removes the cookies. We made sure to use cookies allowing for a secure website.
- User Profile works with updating. However the pfp part is lacking.
- User Profile successfully displays after editting
- Services displays sucessfully and is categorized by enums (from the database)
- The search bars works with filtering
- In the role select, the worker verification works, but not the registration; if isWorker is 1, it goes straight to the worker pages, else registration page. (isWorker is set in the admins page, however is not implemented yet).
- In the role select page, ADMIN password is required. We can change it at any time in our codes. 
- Admin page backend is not implemented, but all the pages are linked, as well as the worker pages
- Customer service details and booking (includes booking process), is not implemented in the backend. The front end is entirely done however.
- The rest of the front end is implemented, but the back end is lacking
